Hello!

After the odin recipes sample project, I tried making my own, which is "NewJeans".

I got the inspiration from New Jeans and incorporate it on how I made the Odin Recipes. It is practice to make git commands. 
I learned that it is easy to make commands with terminal within the VS Code. It is also easy to commit and push.
